# php7-centos7-mysql5.6

## vagrant coming soon

# Completely experimental... DON'T USE IN PRODUCTION
With that being said here's a one liner to get you started with this bleeding edge environment 
```code
yum install git -y;git clone https://github.com/bradallenfisher/php7-centos7-mysql5.6.git; cd php7-centos7-mysql5.6; chmod 700 install.sh; ./install.sh
```
## How to use this
- log into a "FRESH" virtual machine from Linode or Digital Ocean
- run the one liner from above... dunzy!
